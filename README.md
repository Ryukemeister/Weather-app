This weather application is the first website I've ever created using an API. Using the [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) , the openweather weather application retrieves data for the city that the user enters in the search bar. This project taught me how to use JavaScript to fetch and retrieve data to and from an API. Thank you to [Jonah Lawrence
's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZNG8UomjSI) YouTube channel for the weather application tutorial, which assisted me in creating this website.
